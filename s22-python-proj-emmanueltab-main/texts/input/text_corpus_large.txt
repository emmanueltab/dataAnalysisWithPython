the film opens upon two sisters (martha, played by mary pickford, and millie, played by gertrude robinson) standing in a field of daisies. millie plucks the petals off of one to divine whether he loves me... he loves me not. the girls part ways; martha's next stop is the vegetable patch in which a lanky farmhand diligently labors with a shovel. she passes up the farmhand's polite offer to become sweethearts and promptly steals away to town to get her palm read by a woman fortuneteller. there, a mustachioed gypsy catches her eye, and he tells her a fortune in which he "plans her future to his liking". the pair run off together, crossing a brook into which he saves her from falling. they arrive at a waterfall where he "induces her to believe his prophecy must be true". after that brief exchange, martha jubilantly skips home, passing the lanky farmhand who pays her no heed. arriving at the homestead, she immediately resolves to return to the waterfall. at their second meeting, the gypsy greets martha with open arms and after some animated entreaties she meets his embrace. in a brief cutaway, millie looks for martha at the orchard, but can't find her. martha reluctantly bids the gypsy adieu—after she is gone, he laughs and struts confidently. martha's stealthy return escapes the notice of father and millie who are sitting on the porch of the homestead. they seem to accept the explanation of her absence when she motions to the second story of the house. martha then talks millie into getting her own fortune read and they slip away, hand in hand, over a rough-hewn fence, through the field of daisies, and into town. while the fortuneteller is examining millie's palm, martha is distracted by one of the townswomen. the crafty gypsy then swoops in and charms millie into accompanying him to the romantic waterfall. when martha returns to the fortuneteller's tent, millie is nowhere to be found. millie, in the meantime, has bounced home and back to the waterfall, where the gypsy bids her to sit on a conveniently-placed bench. martha wanders back to the waterfall (via the orchard), where she is horrified to find the gypsy with his arm around millie and observes them long enough to witness him kiss millie on the cheek. heartbroken, martha returns to the orchard to weep. to complicate things, father departs the homestead and his route takes him by the waterfall where he discovers his daughter in close personal contact with the gypsy. in a fit of rage, the old man tears the gypsy from his daughter and reproves him wildly. father raises his cane to strike the gypsy, but the gypsy impulsively fells him with a two quick blows to the torso. aghast at what he's done, the gypsy escapes just as two passersby arrive on the scene. the gypsy flees through the field of daisies as a growing mob of farmhands set out looking for him. after passing through an overgrown field and over the brook, the gypsy arrives at the orchard. martha, unaware of his wrongdoing, yields to his pleading and successfully conceals him in a barrel underneath potatoes she empties out of a bushel basket. after the farmhand posse passes, and just as father is recovering with the help of millie and a passerby at the waterfall, the gypsy emerges from the barrel and bids the jilted martha a hasty and perfunctory farewell. the posse eventually catch up with the gypsy back at the fortuneteller's wagon, where they warn him in no uncertain terms to leave town, which he does with a bindle over his shoulder. the dejected martha, sitting on some wooden steps leading up from the road, looks up to find the posse marching the gypsy out of town. she wanders off to the vegetable patch where she finds solace in the arms of the lanky farmhand she had rejected earlier. the film concludes in the field of daisies where millie abandons another round of petal plucking to walk off arm-in-arm with a strapping farmhand who appears out of the blue.

the black arrow: a tale of the two roses
the novel is set in the reign of "old king henry vi" (1422–1461, 1470–1471) and during the wars of the roses (1455–1487). the story begins with the tunstall moat house alarm bell, rung to summon recruits for its absent lord sir daniel brackley, to join the battle of risingham; at which the outlaw "fellowship" known as "the black arrow" begins to strike with its "four black arrows" for the "four black hearts" of brackley and three of his retainers: nicholas appleyard, bennet hatch, and sir oliver oates, the parson. the rhyme posted in explanation of this attack, makes the protagonist richard ('dick') shelton, ward of sir daniel, curious about the death of his father sir harry shelton. having been dispatched to kettley, where sir daniel was quartered, and sent to tunstall moat house by return dispatch, he falls in with a fugitive, joanna sedley, disguised as a boy with the alias of john matcham: an heiress kidnapped by sir daniel to obtain guardianship over her and to retain his control over richard by marrying her to him. as they travel through tunstall forest, joanna tries to persuade dick to turn against sir daniel in sympathy with the black arrow outlaws, whose camp they discover near the ruins of grimstone manor. the next day they are met in the forest by sir daniel himself, disguised as a leper and returning to the moat house after his side was defeated at risingham. dick and joanna then follow sir daniel to the moat house. here dick confirms that sir daniel is the murderer of his father, and escapes injured from the moat house. he is rescued by the outlaws of the black arrow. the second half of the novel, books 3–5, tells how dick rescues joanna from sir daniel with the help of both the black arrow fellowship and the yorkist army led by richard crookback, the future richard iii of england. it centres on shoreby, where the lancastrian forces are entrenched. robert louis stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4–6 of book 3, wherein dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of joanna. they are unsuccessful, and after joanna is moved to sir daniel's main quarters in shoreby, dick visits her in the guise of a franciscan friar. stevenson, the populariser of the tales of the arabian nights, has dick tell the tale of ali baba and the forty thieves in book 4, chapter 6 to help him escape from the ruined sea captain arblaster, whose ship dick and the outlaws had stolen. while shadowing sir daniel, dick and the outlaws encounter another group of spies interested in joanna. after a skirmish in which the outlaws prevail, dick finds that he has conquered joanna's lawful guardian, lord foxham, who promises to give joanna to dick in marriage after a contemplated seaside rescue. there is irony in foxham scolding dick, who is nobly born, for consorting with outlaws when the outlaws are recruited in dick and foxham's plans to rescue joanna. wounded in the failed seaside rescue, foxham writes letters of recommendation for dick to richard crookback, whom dick must find on the outskirts of shoreby. richard crookback, duke of gloucester, makes his appearance in book 5. as dick is leaving shoreby he sees crookback holding his own against seven or eight lancastrian assailants, and assists his victory. dick's accurate knowledge of the lancastrian forces in shoreby aid crookback in winning the battle that he wages later that day. dick is also successful as one of crookback's commanders. crookback knights dick on the field of battle and, following their victory, gives him fifty horsemen to pursue sir daniel, who has escaped shoreby with joanna. dick succeeds in rescuing joanna, but loses his men in the process. he, joanna, and alicia risingham travel to holywood where he and joanna are married. in this way he keeps his initial pledge to joanna to convey her safely to holywood. in the early morning of his wedding day dick encounters a fugitive sir daniel trying to enter holywood seaport to escape to france or burgundy. because it is his wedding day, dick does not want to soil his hands with sir daniel's blood, so he simply bars his way by challenging him either to hand-to-hand combat or alerting a yorkist perimeter patrol. sir daniel retreats, but is shot by ellis duckworth (the outlaws' captain) with the last black arrow. thereafter sir richard and lady shelton live in tunstall moat house untroubled by the rest of the wars of the roses. they provide for both captain arblaster and the outlaw will lawless by pensioning them and settling them in tunstall hamlet, where lawless does a volte face by returning to the franciscan order, taking the name, brother honestus.

his majesty, the scarecrow of oz
king krewl (raymond russell) is a cruel dictator in the emerald city in the land of oz. he wishes to marry his daughter, princess gloria (vivian reed), to an old courtier named googly-goo (arthur smollett), but she is in love with pon, the gardener's boy (todd wright). krewl employs the wicked witch named mombi (mai wells), to freeze the heart of gloria so she will not love pon any longer. this she does by pulling out her heart (which looks somewhere between a valentine and a bland representation of a heart without any vessels) and coating it with ice. meanwhile, a lost little girl from kansas named dorothy gale (violet macmillan), is captured by mombi and imprisoned in her castle. however, dorothy runs away with the now heartless gloria, accompanied by pon and eventually meet the scarecrow (frank moore). mombi catches up with the travelers and removes the scarecrow's stuffing, but dorothy and pon are able to re-stuff him; gloria abandons them and wanders off. they meet the lost little boy, button-bright (mildred harris). the party travels to the winkie country next and arrives at the tin castle of the tin woodman (pierre couderc), who has rusted solid. (the tin woodman resides in a tin castle in later oz novels, beginning in the emerald city of oz'' (1910). mombi reaches the tin castle, and the tin woodman chops off her head; however, this merely slows her down as she hunts for it and places it back on. (the wicked witch of the east in the tin woodman of oz is later described as having done a similar thing to him when he was still human.) having replaced her head, mombi encounters pon and turns him into a kangaroo. dorothy, button-bright, the scarecrow and the tin woodman escape from mombi by crossing a river on a raft. as in the original novel the wonderful wizard of oz (1900), the scarecrow's barge-pole gets stuck in the river bed and leaves him stranded, until he is rescued by a bird. at one point in this sequence, the scarecrow slides down the pole into the river, resulting a brief "underwater" sequence featuring puppet fish and a mermaid; throughout, the scarecrow makes asides to the camera, mostly without intertitles. (at another point, the frozen gloria even makes a malevolent stare directly into the camera.) the party encounters the wizard (j. charles haydon), who tricks mombi by letting the group hide in the red wagon, pulled by the sawhorse; when mombi attempts to follow them, the group escape out the back of the wagon. the four companions meet the cowardly lion, who joins them. the wizard traps mombi in a container of "preserved sandwitches" and paints out the "sand" and the plural, carrying her away in his pocket. the scarecrow, taking a barrage of arrows, tosses krewl's soldiers over the battlements to deal with the cowardly lion, who cannot climb the rope ladder over the city wall. with the support of the people, the scarecrow is easily able to depose king krewl. the wizard releases mombi, and compels her to restore pon to his normal form and unfreeze gloria's heart.

he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the cameron home. in response, the klan hunts down gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him. lynch then orders a crackdown on the klan after discovering gus' murder. he also secures the passing of legislation allowing mixed-race marriages. dr. cameron is arrested for possessing ben's klan regalia, now considered a crime punishable by death. he is rescued by phil stoneman and a few of his black servants. together with margaret cameron, they flee. when their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former union soldiers who agree to hide them. an intertitle states, "the former enemies of north and south are united again in defense of their aryan birthright." congressman stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with lt. gov. lynch's crackdown. elsie, learning of dr. cameron's arrest, goes to lynch to plead for his release. lynch, who had been lusting after elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. stoneman returns, causing elsie to be placed in another room. at first, stoneman is happy when lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is then angered when lynch tells him that it is stoneman's daughter. undercover klansmen spies go to get help when they discover elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. the klan, gathered together at full strength and with ben leading them, rides in to gain control of the town. when news about elsie reaches ben, he and others go to her rescue. elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. lynch is captured. victorious, the klansmen celebrate in the streets. meanwhile, lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the camerons are hiding. the klansmen, with ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. the next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting. the film concludes with a double wedding as margaret cameron marries phil stoneman and elsie stoneman marries ben cameron. the masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. the scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of jesus christ. the penultimate title is: "dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial war shall rule no more. but instead — the gentle prince in the hall of brotherly love in the city of peace."

dr. jekyll and mr. hyde
henry jekyll (john barrymore) is a doctor of medicine, an idealist, and philanthropist. when he is not treating the poor in his free clinic, he is in his laboratory experimenting. sir george carew (brandon hurst), the father of his fiancée, millicent (martha mansfield), is "piqued" by dr. jekyll. "no man could be as good as he looks," carew says. following dinner one night, carew taunts dr. jekyll in front of their friends, edward enfield (cecil clovelly), dr. lanyon (charles lane) and utterson (j. malcolm dunn) proclaiming "in devoting yourself to others, jekyll, aren't you neglecting the development of your own life?" "isn't it by serving others that one develops oneself?" jekyll replies. "which self?" carew retorts. "man has two - as he has two hands. because i use my right hand, should i never use my left? your really strong man fears nothing. it is the weak one who is afraid of experience. a man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses. the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. with your youth, you should live - as i have lived. i have memories. what will you have at my age?" and thus the seed is sown, and jekyll begins his experiments. as he observes, "wouldn't it be marvellous if the two natures in man could be separated - housed in different bodies? think what it would mean to yield to every evil impulse, yet leave the soul untouched!" finally, jekyll develops a potion that turns him into a hideously evil creature that he calls edward hyde. as this creature, he is not recognizable as dr. jekyll, and, so, to facilitate the comings and goings of hyde, he tells his servant, poole (george stevens), that hyde is to have "full authority and liberty about the house." jekyll thus begins to live his double life. hyde sets up a room in one of the seediest parts of london. he brings in a girl from the dance hall, gina (nita naldi), to live with him there and frequents opium dens, dance halls, and bars - any place that satisfies his evil desires. although jekyll has developed a potion that will also return him to his original appearance and character as dr. jekyll, each time he takes the potion to become edward hyde, he worsens. he not only looks more evil, he becomes more evil, as well. millicent carew is worried about the absence of her fiancé, so sir george goes to call on jekyll to see what is the matter. although jekyll is not home when he calls, sir george encounters hyde in the street just as he knocks a small boy to the ground injuring him. to make recompense for his actions, he goes and gets a check which he returns to the boy's father. carew notices that the check has been signed by dr. jekyll. he confronts poole who tells him the story of edward hyde. in the meantime, hyde/jekyll has returned to the lab and, after drinking the potion, returns to his original self. sir george finds him in the lab and demands to know his relationship with "a vile thing like hyde?" "what right have you to question me - you who first tempted me?" says jekyll. sir george angrily retorts that unless jekyll is forthcoming with an explanation, he must object to his marriage to millicent. this angers jekyll to the point that he suddenly becomes hyde, right in front of sir george's eyes, without benefit of the potion. sir george runs into the courtyard where hyde catches him and clubs him to death with his walking stick. hyde runs to his apartment and destroys any evidence that may link him to jekyll. he eludes the police by only minutes and returns to his lab where he is able to drink the potion that restores him as jekyll. in the ensuing days, as millicent grieves, jekyll is tortured by his misdeeds. soon, the drug needed to make the potion that will return him as dr. jekyll is depleted and cannot be found in all of london. jekyll stays locked up in his lab fearing he may become hyde at any moment. millicent finally goes to see him, but just as she is about to enter the lab, he begins to transform into hyde. jekyll consumes the poison in the ring he took from the italian dancer before he opens the door, fully transformed into hyde. he lets her in, locks the door and grabs her in his arms. suddenly, he starts convulsing. millicent runs from the lab and when lanyon comes in, he finds hyde sitting in a chair, having just died, and his appearance returned to that of dr. jekyll. he discerns that jekyll committed suicide, and calls the others (poole, utterson and millicent) in, but declares to them that hyde has killed dr. jekyll. in the final shot, millicent is grieving next to the body of dr. jekyll.

the film is set up as a series of humorous tricks on the audience, with constant doubling, and in which things are rarely what they at first seem to be. it opens with keaton attending a variety show. in this first sequence, keaton plays beside him and remarks, "this fellow keaton seems to be the whole show." this was a gibe at one of keaton's contemporaries, thomas ince, who credited himself generously in his film productions.[1] in interviews with kevin brownlow,[2] keaton claims he gave the director's credit to cline mainly because he did not want to appear too ince-like himself: "having kidded things like that, i hesitated to put my own name on as a director and writer." this elaborate trick-photography sequence turns out to be only a dream when joe roberts rouses keaton from bed. the bedroom then turns out to be not a bedroom, but a set on a stage. the second half of the film features keaton's character falling for a girl who happens to be a twin. he has difficulty telling the twin who likes him from the one who does not. an uncredited virginia fox plays one of the twins. edward f. cline co-wrote the production and appears, uncredited, as a monkey trainer, whose monkey keaton impersonates onstage after accidentally letting the animal escape.

the ten commandments
despite its epic scale, the moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. after that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. two brothers make opposite decisions, one, john, to follow his mother's teaching of the ten commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. the film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. a thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. the mother reads the story of moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of god. the carpenter, however, reads from the new testament story of jesus's healing of lepers. his emphasis is on a loving and forgiving god. the film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. one day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. one of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. in her dying breath, she tells danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear god, when she should have taught him love. this sends danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. to make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. he attempts to flee to mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed. throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story.

girl shy
harold meadows (lloyd) is a tailor's apprentice for his uncle in little bend, california. he is so shy around women that he can barely speak to them (to stop his stuttering, his uncle has to blow a whistle). despite this, harold writes a "how to" book for young men entitled the secret of making love, detailing how to woo different types of young women, such as "the vampire" and "the flapper" (in scenes that parodied two other popular films of the time, trifling women and flaming youth[citation needed]), and takes a train to see a publisher in los angeles. the same day, rich young mary buckingham (ralston) boards the same train after her automobile breaks down in little bend. no dogs are allowed aboard, so she hides her pomeranian under her shawl, but her pet jumps off as the train pulls away. harold rescues her dog and helps mary hide it from the conductor. she sees his manuscript, so he starts telling her about his book, overcoming his stuttering in his enthusiasm. they become so absorbed in each other that neither realizes that the train has reached its final destination and everyone else has departed. upon returning home, mary rejects the latest in a string of marriage proposals from persistent suitor ronald devore, a self-centered rich man who is almost twice mary's age and who harbors no true feelings for her, but merely wants her as a trophy wife. after her car is repaired, mary intentionally detours through little bend repeatedly, hoping to see harold again. on one such trip, ronald is also along for the ride, and his unwanted attentions cause mary to swerve and get her car stuck near the outskirts of little bend. while ronald walks back to town for a tow, mary goes for a walk and happens to reunite with harold. after telling mary about the remainder of his book, harold informs her that he is going to see the publisher, roger thornby, in a few days to deliver a new chapter that will be about her. they agree to meet again afterward. meanwhile, ronald runs into a middle-aged woman who asks if he is finally going to introduce her to his family, but he stalls, then rides away in the tow-vehicle. mr. thornby's professional readers find harold's book hilariously absurd, so he rejects it. without any royalty money, harold figures he cannot ask mary to marry him. so he pretends that he was only using her as part of his research. heartbroken, mary impulsively agrees to marry ronald. afterward, though, one of mr. thornby's senior employees convinces him that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so thornby decides to publish it as "the boob's diary". a few days later, a depressed harold gets a letter from the publisher, but just rips it up without opening it, assuming that it is a rejection notice. fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000; the accompanying letter states that the book will be published as a comedy. at first, harold is outraged, but then he realizes that he can propose to mary after all. however, when he sees a newspaper headline announcing mary and ronald's wedding that same day at her family's estate, he gives up. by chance, the same woman whom ronald had met a few days earlier walks in and, seeing the newspaper story, tearfully exclaims that she is ronald's wife. as proof, she shows harold a locket with the couple's wedding portrait and the engraved words "to my wife" that ronald had given her two years earlier. harold embarks on a frenzied headlong dash, involving bootleggers, car chases and multiple changes of vehicle (from missing the train to various cars to a trolley to a police motorcycle to a horse-drawn wagon to horseback), through the countryside and along the crowded streets of culver city and los angeles. he bursts in just in time, but he cannot stop stuttering long enough to expose ronald's intended bigamy. so harold simply carries mary off. when they are alone, he tells her about ronald's secret and shows her the locket. mary gets harold to propose (with an assist from a passing mail carrier's whistle), and she accepts.

ahmed robs as he pleases in the city of baghdad. wandering into a mosque, he tells the holy man he disdains his religion; his philosophy is, "what i want, i take." that night, he sneaks into the palace of the caliph using a magic rope he stole during ritual prayers. all thoughts of plunder are forgotten when he sees the sleeping princess, the caliph's daughter. the princess's mongol slave discovers him and alerts the guards, but he gets away. when his associate abu reminds the disconsolate ahmed that a bygone thief once stole another princess during the reign of haroun al-rashid, ahmed sets out to do the same. the next day is the princess's birthday. three princes arrive, seeking her hand in marriage (and the future inheritance of the city). another of the princess's slaves foretells that she will marry he who first touches a rose-tree in her garden. the princess watches anxiously as first the glowering prince of the indies, then the obese prince of persia (an uncredited mathilde comont), and finally the prince of the mongols pass by the rose-tree. the mere sight of the mongol fills the princess with fear, but when ahmed appears (disguised in stolen garments as a suitor), she is delighted. the mongol slave tells her countryman of the prophecy, but before he can touch the rose-tree, ahmed's startled horse tosses its rider into it. that night, following ancient custom, the princess chooses ahmed for her husband. out of love, ahmed gives up his plan to abduct her and confesses all to her in private. the mongol prince learns from his spy, the princess's mongol slave, that ahmed is a common thief and informs the caliph. ahmed is lashed mercilessly, and the caliph orders he be torn apart by a giant ape, but the princess has the guards bribed to let him go. when the caliph insists she select another husband, her loyal slave advises her to delay. she asks that the princes each bring her a gift after "seven moons"; she will marry the one who brings her the rarest. in despair, ahmed turns to the holy man. he tells the thief to become a prince, revealing to him the peril-fraught path to a great treasure. the prince of the indies obtains a magic crystal ball from the eye of a giant idol, which shows whatever he wants to see, while the persian prince buys a flying carpet. the mongol prince leaves behind his henchman, telling him to organize the soldiers he will send to bagdad disguised as porters. (the potentate has sought all along to take the city; the beautiful princess is only an added incentive.) after he lays his hands on a magic apple which has the power to cure anything, even death, he sends word to the mongol slave to poison the princess. after many adventures, ahmed gains a cloak of invisibility and a small chest of magic powder which turns into whatever he wishes when he sprinkles it. he races back to the city. the three princes meet as agreed at a caravansary before returning to bagdad. the mongol asks the indian to check whether the princess has waited for them. they discover that she is near death, and ride the flying carpet to reach her. then the mongol uses the apple to cure her. the suitors argue over which gift is rarest, but the princess points out that without any one gift, the remaining two would have been useless in saving her life. her loyal slave shows her ahmed in the crystal ball, so the princess convinces her father to deliberate carefully on his future son-in-law. the mongol prince chooses not to wait, unleashing his secret army that night and capturing bagdad. ahmed arrives at the city gate, shut and manned by mongols. when he conjures up a large army with his powder, the mongol soldiers flee. the mongol prince is about to have one of his men kill him when the mongol slave suggests he escape with the princess on the flying carpet. ahmed liberates the city and rescues the princess, using his cloak of invisibility to get through the mongols guarding their prince. in gratitude, the caliph gives his daughter to him in marriage.

the queen orders cesar’s arrest. the best man to find him: that one-eyed ferret, colonel matsado (albert macquarrie). but when matsado stops at a country inn on his way into the city, cesar waylays him, steals his uniform, and impersonates him. back in the city cesar as matsado pretends to beat his (now fabrique's) old manservant robledo (charles stevens) for information on cesar's whereabouts, then convinces fabrique to accompany him to the ruins where cesar has been living these past months. there he is determined to find what hold fabrique has on sebastian. in a whirlwind finish, sebastian and the real matsado track cesar to his lair, as do his father, zorro (fairbanks), who with the mute faithful family servant bernardo (tote du crow), has sailed from california to spain to help. on the way to the ruins they pass dolores and her mother along the same road. finally, as all gather at the ruins, zorro and don q battle the soldiers, fabrique confesses, sebastian is beaten, de muro recognizes his old friend, the villains are arrested, and cesar and dolores reunited.

phantom of the opera
the film opens with the debut of the new season at the paris opera house, with a production of gounod's faust. comte philippe de chagny (john st. polis) and his brother, the vicomte raoul de chagny (norman kerry) are in attendance. raoul attends only in the hope of hearing his sweetheart christine daaé (mary philbin) sing. christine has made a sudden rise from the chorus to understudy of mme. carlotta, the prima donna. raoul visits her in her dressing room during the performance, and makes his intentions known that he wishes for christine to resign and marry him. christine refuses to let their relationship get in the way of her career. at the height of the most prosperous season in the opera's history, the management suddenly resign. as they leave, they tell the new managers of the opera ghost, a phantom who asks for opera box #5, among other things. the new managers laugh it off as a joke, but the old management leaves troubled. after the performance, the ballerinas are disturbed by the sight of a mysterious man in a fez (arthur edmund carewe), who dwells in the cellars. arguing whether or not he is the phantom, they decide to ask joseph buquet, a stagehand who has actually seen the ghost's face. buquet describes a ghastly sight of a living skeleton to the girls, who are then startled by a shadow cast on the wall. the antics of stagehand florine papillon (snitz edwards) do not amuse joseph's brother, simon (gibson gowland), who chases him off. meanwhile, mme. carlotta (virginia pearson), the prima donna of the paris grand opera, barges into the managers' office enraged. she has received a letter from "the phantom," demanding that christine sing the role of marguerite the following night, threatening dire consequences if his demands are not met. christine is in her dressing room at that moment, speaking to a phantom voice (which the audience sees as a shadow on a wall behind the dressing room.) the voice warns her that she will take carlotta's place on wednesday and that she is to think only of her career and her master. the following day, in a garden near the opera house, raoul meets christine and asks her to reconsider his offer. christine admits that she has been tutored by a divine voice, the "spirit of music," and that it is now impossible to stop her career. raoul tells her that he thinks someone is playing a joke on her, and she storms off in anger. wednesday evening, carlotta is ill and christine takes her place in the opera. during the performance, the managers go to box 5 to see exactly who has taken it. the keeper of the box does not know who it is, as she has never seen his face. the two managers enter the box and are startled to see a shadowy figure seated there. they run out of the box and compose themselves, but when they enter the box again, the person is gone. in her next performance, christine reaches her triumph during the finale and receives a standing ovation from the audience. when raoul visits her in her dressing room, she pretends not to recognize him, because unbeknownst to those in the room, the phantom voice is present. meanwhile, simon buquet finds the body of his brother, joseph, hanging by the strangler's noose and vows vengeance. raoul spends the evening outside her door, and after the others have left, just as he is about to enter, he hears the voice within the room. he overhears the voice make his intentions to christine: "soon, christine, this spirit will take form and will demand your love!" when christine leaves her room alone, raoul breaks in to find it empty. carlotta receives another discordant note from the phantom. once again, it demands that she take ill and let christine have her part. the managers also get a note, reiterating that if christine does not sing, they will present "faust" in a house with a curse on it. the following evening, despite the phantom's warnings, a defiant carlotta appears as marguerite. at first, the performance goes well, but soon the phantom's curse takes its effect, backstage, causing the great crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror, descending, in a dream-like sequence, semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the opera. she is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked phantom into his lair. the phantom introduces himself as erik and declares his love; christine faints, so erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. the next day, when she awakens, she finds a note from erik telling her that she is free to come and go as she pleases, but that she must never look behind his mask. in the next room, the phantom is playing his composition, "don juan triumphant." christine's curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneaks up behind the phantom and tears off his mask, revealing his hideously deformed face. enraged, the phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known. in an attempt to plead to him, he excuses her to visit her world one last time, with the condition that she never sees her lover again. released from the underground dungeon, christine makes a rendezvous at the annual masked-ball, which is graced with the phantom in the guise of the 'red-death' from the edgar allan poe short story of the same name. raoul finds christine and they flee to the roof of the opera house, where she tells him everything that followed the chandelier crash. however, an unseen jealous phantom perching on the statue of apollo overhears them. raoul plans to whisk christine safely away to london following the next performance. as they leave the roof, the mysterious man with the fez approaches them. aware that the phantom is waiting downstairs, he leads christine and raoul to another exit. the following evening, raoul meets christine in her dressing room. she has heard the voice of the phantom, who has revealed that he knows their plans. raoul has arranged for a carriage and reassures her nothing will go wrong. during the performance, the phantom kidnaps christine off the stage during a blackout. raoul rushes to christine's dressing room, and meets the man in the fez, who reveals himself to be inspector ledoux, a secret policeman who has been studying erik's moves as the phantom since he escaped as a prisoner from devil's island. ledoux reveals the secret door in christine's room and the two men enter the catacombs of the opera house in an attempt to rescue christine. instead, they fall into the phantom's dungeon, a torture room of his design. philippe has also found his way into the catacombs looking for his brother, and a clanging alarm alerts the phantom to his presence in a canoe on the lake. phillipe is drowned by erik, who returns to find the two men in the torture chamber. turning a switch, the phantom subjects the two prisoners to intense heat; the two manage to escape the chamber by opening a door in the floor as they are about to perish. in the chamber below, the phantom shuts a gate, locking them in with barrels full of gunpowder. the phantom gives christine a choice of two levers: one shaped like a scorpion and the other like a grasshopper. one of them will save raoul's life, but at the cost of christine marrying erik, while the other will blow up the barrels in the chamber raoul and ledoux are trapped in, in effect destroying the opera house and killing them all. christine picks the scorpion, but it is a trick by the phantom to "save" raoul and ledoux from being killed by drowning them. christine begs the phantom to save raoul, promising him anything in return, even becoming his wife. at the last second, the phantom opens a trapdoor in his floor through which raoul and ledoux are saved. a mob, led by simon, infiltrates the phantom's lair. as the clanging alarm sounds and the mob approaches, the phantom attempts to flee with christine in the carriage meant for raoul and christine. while raoul saves christine, the phantom is pursued and killed by a mob, who throw him into the river seine to finally drown. in a brief epilogue, raoul and christine are shown on their honeymoon in viroflay.

western & atlantic railroad train engineer johnnie gray (keaton) is in marietta, georgia to see one of the two loves of his life, his fiancée annabelle lee (marion mack)—the other being his locomotive, the general—when the american civil war breaks out. he hurries to be first in line to enlist in the confederate army, but is rejected because he is too valuable in his present job; unfortunately, johnnie is not told this reason and is forcibly ejected. on leaving, he runs into annabelle's father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he sadly walks away, giving them the impression that he does not want to enlist. annabelle coldly informs johnnie that she will not speak to him again until he is in uniform. a year passes, and annabelle receives word that her father has been wounded. she travels north on the w&arr with the general pulling the train to see him but still wants nothing to do with johnnie. when the train makes a stop, the passengers detrain for a quick meal. as planned, union spies led by captain anderson (glen cavender) use the opportunity to steal the train. anderson's objective is to burn all the railroad bridges he passes, thus preventing reinforcement and resupply of the confederate army facing union general parker's army. annabelle becomes an inadvertent prisoner of the raiders. johnnie gives chase, first on foot, then by handcar and boneshaker bicycle, before reaching a station in chattanooga. he alerts the army detachment there, which boards another train to give chase, with johnnie manning the locomotive, texas. however, the flatcars are not hooked up to the engine, and the troops are left behind. by the time johnnie realizes he is alone, it is too late to turn back. the union agents try a variety of methods to shake their dogged pursuer (convinced he is accompanied by confederate soldiers), including disconnecting their trailing car and dropping railroad ties on the tracks. as the unusual duel continues northward, the confederate army of tennessee is ordered to retreat and the northern army advances in its wake. johnnie finally notices he is surrounded by union soldiers and the hijackers see that johnnie is by himself. johnnie stops the texas and runs into the forest to hide. at nightfall, johnnie stumbles upon the northern encampment. hungry, he climbs through a window to steal some food, but hides underneath the table when some officers enter. he overhears their plan for a surprise attack and that the rock river bridge is essential for their supply trains to support the attack. he then sees annabelle brought in; she is taken to a room under guard while they decide what to do with her. johnnie manages to knock out both guards and free annabelle. they escape into the woods under cover of a rainstorm. the next day, johnnie and annabelle find themselves near a railway station, where union soldiers and equipment are being organized for the attack. seeing the general, johnnie devises a plan to warn the south. after sneaking annabelle onto a boxcar behind the general, johnnie steals his engine back. two union trains, including the texas, set out after the pair, while the union attack is immediately launched. in a reversal of the first chase, johnnie now has to fend off his pursuers. finally, he starts a fire behind the general in the center of the rock river bridge to cut off his pursuers and the union's important supply line. reaching friendly lines, johnnie warns the local confederate commander of the impending attack. confederate forces rush to defend the bridge. meanwhile, annabelle is reunited with her convalescing father. the texas drives onto the burning bridge, which collapses (in what would later come to be recognized as the most expensive stunt of the silent era).[4] union soldiers try to ford the river, but confederate fire drives them back. afterward, johnnie returns to his locomotive to find the union officer whom he had knocked out earlier in order to escape regaining consciousness. he takes the officer prisoner and is spotted by the general leaving the locomotive with him. as a reward for his bravery, he is commissioned a lieutenant and given the captured officer's sword. returning to the general with annabelle, he tries to kiss his girl but has to return the salutes of troops walking past. johnnie finally uses his left hand to embrace annabelle while using his right to blindly salute the passing soldiers while he kisses her as the screen fades to black.

in a decaying mansion overlooking the hudson river, millionaire cyrus west approaches death. his greedy family descends upon him like "cats around a canary", causing him to become insane. west orders that his last will and testament remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. as the appointed time arrives, west's lawyer, roger crosby (tully marshall), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. the second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. the caretaker of the west mansion, mammy pleasant (martha mattox), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of cyrus west, a notion that the astonished crosby quickly rejects. as midnight approaches, west's relatives arrive at the mansion: nephews harry blythe (arthur edmund carewe), charles "charlie" wilder, paul jones, his sister susan sillsby (flora finch) and her niece cecily young (gertrude astor), and niece annabelle west. cyrus west's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name west: annabelle. the will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, ira lazar (lucien littlefield). if she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. the fortune includes the west diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle, "in a cage surrounded by cats." while the family prepares for dinner, a guard (george siegmann) barges in and announces that an escaped lunatic called the cat is either in the house or on the grounds. the guard tells cecily, "he's a maniac who thinks he's a cat, and tears his victims like they were canaries!" meanwhile, crosby suspects someone in the family might try to harm annabelle and decides to inform her of her successor. before he speaks the person's name, a hairy hand with long nails emerges from a secret passage in a bookshelf and pulls him in, terrifying annabelle. when she explains what happened to crosby, the family immediately concludes that she is insane. alone in her assigned room, annabelle examines a note slipped to her which reveals the location of the family jewels, fashioned into an elaborate necklace. she follows the note's instructions and soon discovers the hiding place, in a secret panel above the fireplace. she retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn. while annabelle sleeps, the same mysterious hand emerges from the wall behind her bed and snatches the diamonds from her neck. once again, her sanity is questioned, but as harry and annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of roger crosby. mammy pleasant leaves to call the police, while harry searches for the guard; susan runs away in hysterics and hitches a ride with a milkman (joe murphy). paul and annabelle return to her room to search for the missing envelope, and discover that crosby's body is missing. paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. wandering in the hidden passages, paul is attacked by the cat and left for dead. he regains consciousness in time to rescue annabelle. the police arrive and arrest the cat, who is charlie wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. wilder is the person named in the second will; he hoped to drive annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.

chicago
the plot of the film is drawn from the play chicago by maurine dallas watkins which was in turn based on the true story of beulah annan, fictionalized as roxie hart (phyllis haver), and her spectacular murder of her boyfriend. the silent film adds considerably to the material in watkins' play, some additions based on the original murder, and some for hollywood considerations. the murder, which occurs in a very brief vignette before the play begins, is fleshed out considerably. also, roxie's husband amos hart (played by victor varconi) has a much more sympathetic and active role in the film than he does either in the play or in the subsequent musical. the ending is crueler to roxie, in keeping with hollywood values of not allowing criminals to profit too much from their crimes (although she does get away with murder).

the jazz singer
cantor rabinowitz wants his son to carry on the generations-old family tradition and become a cantor at the synagogue in the jewish ghetto of manhattan's lower east side. but down at the beer garden, thirteen-year-old jakie rabinowitz is performing so-called jazz tunes. moisha yudelson spots the boy and tells jakie's father, who drags him home. jakie clings to his mother, sara, as his father declares, "i'll teach him better than to debase the voice god gave him!" jakie threatens: "if you whip me again, i'll run away — and never come back!" after the whipping, jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. at the yom kippur service, rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, "my son was to stand at my side and sing tonight – but now i have no son." as the sacred kol nidre is sung, jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother. about 10 years later, jakie has changed his name to the more assimilated jack robin. jack is called up from his table at a cabaret to perform on stage. jack wows the crowd with his energized rendition. afterward, he is introduced to the beautiful mary dale, a musical theater dancer. "there are lots of jazz singers, but you have a tear in your voice," she says, offering to help with his budding career. with her help, jack eventually gets his big break: a leading part in the new musical april follies. back at the family home jack left long ago, the elder rabinowitz instructs a young student in the traditional cantorial art. jack appears and tries to explain his point of view, and his love of modern music, but the appalled cantor banishes him: "i never want to see you again — you jazz singer!" as he leaves, jack makes a prediction: "i came home with a heart full of love, but you don't want to understand. some day you'll understand, the same as mama does." two weeks after jack's expulsion from the family home and 24 hours before opening night of april follies on broadway, jack's father falls gravely ill. jack is asked to choose between the show and duty to his family and faith: in order to sing the kol nidre for yom kippur in his father's place, he will have to miss the big premiere. that evening, the eve of yom kippur, yudleson tells the jewish elders, "for the first time, we have no cantor on the day of atonement." lying in his bed, weak and gaunt, cantor rabinowitz tells sara that he cannot perform on the most sacred of holy days: "my son came to me in my dreams—he sang kol nidre so beautifully. if he would only sing like that tonight—surely he would be forgiven." as jack prepares for a dress rehearsal by applying blackface makeup, he and mary discuss his career aspirations and the family pressures they agree he must resist. sara and yudleson come to jack's dressing room to plea for him to come to his father and sing in his stead. jack is torn. he delivers his blackface performance ("mother of mine, i still have you"), and sara sees her son onstage for the first time. she has a tearful revelation: "here he belongs. if god wanted him in his house, he would have kept him there. he's not my boy anymore—he belongs to the whole world now." afterward, jack returns to the rabinowitz home. he kneels at his father's bedside and the two converse fondly: "my son—i love you." sara suggests that it may help heal his father if jack takes his place at the yom kippur service. mary arrives with the producer, who warns jack that he'll never work on broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. jack can't decide. mary challenges him: "were you lying when you said your career came before everything?" jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: "i haven't sung kol nidre since i was a little boy." his mother tells him, "do what is in your heart, jakie—if you sing and god is not in your voice — your father will know." the producer cajoles jack: "you're a jazz singer at heart!" at the theater, the opening night audience is told that there will be no performance. jack sings the kol nidre in his father's place. his father listens from his deathbed to the nearby ceremony and speaks his last, forgiving words: "mama, we have our son again." the spirit of jack's father is shown at his side in the synagogue. mary has come to listen. she sees how jack has reconciled the division in his soul: "a jazz singer—singing to his god." "the season passes—and time heals—the show goes on." jack, as "the jazz singer," is now appearing at the winter garden theater, apparently as the featured performer opening for a show called back room. in the front row of the packed theater, his mother sits alongside yudleson. jack, in blackface, performs the song "my mammy" for her and for the world.

we see mary magdalene, here portrayed as a wild courtesan, entertain many men around her. upon learning that judas is with a carpenter she rides out on her chariot drawn by zebras to get him back. peter is introduced as the giant apostle, and we see the future gospel writer mark as a child who is healed by jesus. mary, the mother of jesus, is shown as a beautiful and saintly woman who is a mother to all her son's followers. our first sight of jesus is through the eyesight of a little girl, whom he heals. he is surrounded by a halo. mary magdelene arrives afterwards and talks to judas, who reveals that he is only staying with jesus in hopes of being made a high official after jesus becomes the king of kings. jesus casts the seven deadly sins out of mary magdalene in a multiple exposure sequence. jesus is also shown resurrecting lazarus and healing the little children. some humor is derived when one girl asks if he can heal broken legs, and, when he says yes, she gives him a legless doll. jesus smiles and repairs the doll. the crucifixion is foreshadowed when jesus, having helped a poor family, wanders through the father's carpentry shop, and, himself a carpenter's son, he briefly helps carve a piece of wood. when a sheet covering the object is removed, it is revealed to be a cross towering over jesus. jesus and his apostles enter jerusalem, where judas incites the people and rallies them to proclaim jesus king of the jews. jesus, however, renounces all claims of being an earthly king. caiaphas the high priest is also angry at judas for having led people to a man whom he sees as a false prophet. meanwhile, jesus drives away satan, who had offered him an earthly kingdom, and he protects a woman caught in adultery. the words he draws in the sand are revealed to be the sins the accusers themselves committed. judas, desperate to save himself from caiaphas, agrees to turn over jesus. noticeably at the last supper, when jesus distributes the bread and wine saying that they are his body and blood, judas refuses to eat. judas puts the cup to his lips but refuses to drink; he tears off a piece of bread but lets it drop to the ground. towards the end, mary confronts her son and tells him to flee from the danger that is coming. jesus replies that it must be done for the salvation of all peoples. they leave the room but the camera focuses on the table upon which a dove alights for a moment. jesus goes to the garden of gethsemane where he is soon captured by the roman soldiers and betrayed by judas. judas' life is saved, but, upon seeing that jesus is going to be killed as a result, he is horrified. judas takes a rope that the romans had used to bind jesus' wrists and runs off. jesus is beaten and then presented by pontius pilate to the crowd. mary pleads for the life of her son and mary magdalene speaks for him but caiaphas bribes the crowd to shout against jesus. jesus is taken away to be crucified, though he pauses on the via dolorosa to heal a group of cripples in an alley, despite his weakened condition. jesus is crucified and his enemies throw insults at him. (one woman even anachronistically eats popcorn and smiles with glee at jesus' crucifixion.) when jesus does die, however, a great earthquake comes up. the tree where judas had hanged himself, with the rope used to bind jesus's wrists, is swallowed up amidst gouts of hellfire. the sky turns black, lightning strikes, the wind blows, the people who had mocked jesus run in terror, and the veil covering the holy of holies in the jerusalem temple is torn in two. the tumult ends when mary looks up at heaven and asks god to forgive the world for the death of their son. the chaos ends and the sun shines. jesus is taken down from the cross and is buried. on the third day, he rises from the dead as promised. to emphasize the importance of the resurrection, this scene from an otherwise black and white film is shot in color. jesus goes to the apostles and tells them to spread his message to the world. he tells them "i am with you always" as the scene shifts to a modern city to show that jesus still watches over his followers. many of the film's intertitles are quotes (or paraphrases) from scripture, often with chapter and verse accompanying.

london after midnight
in a cultured and peaceful home on the outskirts of london,[9] the head of the household, sir roger balfour, is found dead from what initially appears to be a self-inflicted bullet wound, despite the insistence of balfour's friend and neighbour, sir james hamlin, that his old friend would never have taken his own life. nonetheless, balfour's death is officially declared a suicide by inspector edward c. burke of scotland yard.[9][10][11] five years later, with the case still unresolved, a sinister-looking man with pointed teeth wearing a beaver-skin top hat, arrives at the household accompanied by a cadaverous-looking woman in a long gown; the arrival of these two individuals prompts sir james hamlin, the friend and neighbour of the late roger balfour, to call scotland yard. this in turn prompts inspector burke to travel to the household, where he discovers that three individuals now present in the household had been the only three who had been present five years previously when roger balfour had died. initially, burke remains sceptical that any of these three individuals (balfour's daughter, lucille, his butler williams, and arthur hibbs,[12] the nephew/secretary of the neighbour who had placed the call to scotland yard) may have been involved in his murder, until balfour's body disappears from its tomb and an individual looking distinctly like him is seen around the old balfour estate. this, in addition to other eerie acts such as instances of singular gunshots being heard in roger balfour's former bedroom occurring in the household while burke is there and the sinister-looking man in the beaver hat repeatedly terrifying those within the household, prompts him to determine to identify balfour's killer by reproducing the former crime scene and using hypnosis to induce the culprit into re-enacting the murder.[10][11][13][13][13][13]

my best girl
the film starts out at the merrill department store where a very exhausted stockgirl named maggie johnson (mary pickford) is given a moment to attend to the sales counter. there she encounters a charming handsome man who pretends to be interested in purchasing some children's toys but, after many humorous demonstrations by maggie, the manager comes over and gives the man his time card. the man is said to be joe grant (buddy rogers) though in reality he is the son of the owner; making him joseph merrill. to prove to his father he is ready for his engagement, he has taken the job of stockboy under an assumed name. annoyed, maggie takes joe back to the stockroom and tells him to get to work. he is so inept that she calls him, 'the dumbest stockboy in the world' though she promises to take him under her wing, much to his amusement. a few days later, after her shift, maggie is outside waiting for joe. she appears to have a crush on him. some of her coworkers tease her but eventually warn her that joe is coming, causing maggie to hop on her ride home from work: the back of an open truck. joe is swarmed with salesgirls who try for his attention causing him to not focus on maggie. determined maggie throws her bag on the ground as the vehicle pulls away. joe picks it up and chases the truck down to give it to her. after three more times of this, he finally grows weary and jumps in the truck to join maggie, who feigns innocence. the two flirt and maggie shows him pictures of her off-kilter family. once they reach her home, she invites him in for supper only to find her family is causing a commotion. her father (lucien littlefield) is an elderly postal worker who is meek and easily subdued. her mother (sunshine hart) is a dramatic woman who enjoys going to random funerals and makes frequent use of smelling salts to avoid fainting. her sister liz (carmelita geraghty) is a flapper who has a boyfriend who gets her into trouble. maggie does her best to hide the goings on but eventually caves and sends joe on his way hoping to have dinner with him another day. time passes and joe's mother is planning his engagement announcement party. however she has not mentioned it to him, hoping to make it a surprise. joe has been promoted and is now maggie's boss. however, he still eats lunch with her every day in the stockroom. during one such lunch, after receiving the note to join his parents for dinner (for the surprise party), maggie gives him a watch for his birthday. he is touched and puts it on. shortly after this he accidentally catches his sleeve on a nail. trying to pull himself free, he accidentally puts his arm around maggie, and after the mutual surprise the two kiss. enamored with each other they head out on the town to walk in the rain. joe begins to spend money and she tells him he'll end up in the poorhouse. joe offers to buy her dinner at a nice restaurant but, embarrassed by her shoddy work clothes, maggie declines. joe gets the idea to tell her they should follow the store's company motto, "we're all a family" and that, if they were family, they could eat at the merrill mansion. maggie, thinking he is joking, agrees. meanwhile, her sister is arrested because of her association with her boyfriend, and is taken to night court. her family frets at not being able to find maggie, who they believe needs to help liz out of the mess. maggie had tried to call them, but after a few rings (while her father made his way to the phone) she hung up. arriving at the merrill mansion, maggie is amazed that it is the real deal. joe is amused with her reluctance but eventually gets her into the mansion, much to the butler's amusement. maggie is extremely reluctant until joe convinces the butler to say 'a merrill employee eats here almost every night!' maggie relaxes and tells joe they should pretend to be mr. and mrs. merrill. joe is extremely amused by this, and at her lack of formal dinner habits. at the surprise engagement party, joe's family sits concerned. they return home to find joe and maggie, who has hidden under the table. joe admits he is 'joseph merrill' but before he can explain further his fiancee (avonne taylor) arrives and kisses him in front of maggie. maggie, heartbroken leaves. joe, upset, tells his fiancee he had broken maggie's heart and must go after her. maggie walks and walks until she returns to where joe and her shared a moment which happens to be by the night court. she sees her family arrive and after they chasten her they enter the court to try to save liz from prison. meanwhile joe arrives at the same spot only to be helped by a homeless man who had watched their interactions. joe enters the court to hear maggie's passionate plea for her sister, whom the judge eventually lets go. while maggie fetches water for her 'on the verge of fainting' mother, joe walks over to maggie and apologizes, saying he did not love his fiancee and would not marry her. he then proposes to maggie which causes (for a change) her sister to faint. while everyone tries to revive liz, liz's boyfriend makes a remark to her father about maggie 'taking up with the merrill boy' implying that it was only for sex. joe, offended, punches him and begins to fight in the courtroom. the next day, maggie is back home, reading the paper which has headlines about their romance. joe's father (hobart bosworth) arrives at the home. he tells maggie he wants to send his son to hawaii until the scandal blew over, which joe agreed to. however, joe apparently made plans to bring maggie as well and marry on the boat. mr. merrill, not happy with this, tries to buy maggie off with a check for $10,000 just as joe arrives, unaware his father is there. joe tells maggie his plans and she becomes upset. angry, she begins a whole tirade against him trying to find out if he really loved her or not. she begins to claim she is just a jazz girl and knew who he was all along. that she was a gold digger and just after his money and, thanks to his father, she now had what she wanted. she even plays a jazz record and puts on lipstick in an attempt to prove her point. joe begins to cry, and maggie, touched, breaks down and admits that none of it is true and the real reason she cannot go away with him is because of her family (who had been listening in the living room the whole time) who needs her more than he does. her father becomes livid and declares it was time 'he became the father of the family' and takes charge of his wife and daughters. in a comedic scene he commands everyone (including both merrills) to pack maggie's things for the ship which leaves in ten minutes. after an extreme car ride, the couple barely make it to the departing boat. once boarded, the father realizes he never gave maggie her suitcase. he tries to throw the suitcase onto the boat, but it ends up in the ocean. the couple waves goodbye and eventually get crowded back from view. when the crowd leaves, we see the couple kissing.

during the first world war, two american soldiers become trapped in no man's land. expecting to die, w. dangerfield phelps iii (william boyd) decides to fulfill his fondest desire: to beat up his sergeant since training camp, peter o'gaffney (louis wolheim). while they are brawling, the germans sneak up and capture them. in a german prison camp, the two become friends when phelps takes responsibility for an unflattering caricature he drew of a guard, rather than let o'gaffney take the blame. the two escape, stealing the white robes of arab prisoners to blend in with the snow. however, they encounter (and are forced to join) a group of similarly garbed arab prisoners being sent by train to constantinople. near the end of their journey, phelps creates a distraction, and the two men jump off, landing in a hay wagon. when the hay is loaded onto a ship bound for arabia, so are they. the stowaways are discovered, but the skipper (michael visaroff) is satisfied when phelps pays him their fare. when a small boat founders nearby, phelps jumps in to try to rescue an arabian woman, mirza (mary astor). both he and the woman have to be saved by o'gaffney. the two soldiers and the skipper vie for the veiled woman's affections. phelps eventually coaxes her into removing her veil, and is entranced by her beauty. meanwhile, the woman's escort observes this development with disapproval. the skipper insists on being paid for mirza's fare, but none of the three have any money left. they hold him off as best they can. when they reach their destination, the skipper refuses to let mirza debark without paying, so o'gaffney robs the purser (boris karloff) to get the money. mirza is met by shevket ben ali (ian keith); mirza informs phelps that her father has arranged for her to marry shevket. they depart. the americans jump overboard when the skipper discovers what happened to his purser. the two men head for the american consul, but leave hastily without speaking to him when they find the skipper already there lodging a complaint. they decide to seek the assistance of mirza's father the emir, who turns out to be the governor of the region. however, mirza's escort has told him and shevket that phelps has seen her without her veil. outraged, the emir sends his men to bring the americans back to be executed. unaware of this, the two soldiers saunter into the emir's palace. fortunately, phelps reads mirza's warning note in time, and the two escape. when phelps sets out to rescue mirza, o'gaffney shows true friendship and accompanies him. they are trapped by shevket and his men, but when mirza threatens to kill herself, shevket proposes they settle this with a duel in which only one of the pistols is loaded. phelps agrees and fires first; his gun is the unloaded one. mirza is made to leave the room. then shevket reveals that both guns are empty; he did not wish to wager his life with a "dog". he exits, leaving his men to dispose of phelps. the two men overcome their captors, relieve shevket of mirza, and ride away.

an american tramp steamer docks in new york harbor sometime in the early years of the 20th century before prohibition. in the bowels of the ship, coal stokers are shutting down the furnaces and anticipating a night of shore leave. the bullying third engineer, andy (mitchell lewis) warns the exhausted crew that they will be punished if they return drunk when the vessel sails the following morning. the stokers gather to leer at crude pornographic graffiti scrawled on the engine room wall before debarking to carouse at the local gin-mills. on shore, andy enters the "the sandbar", dance-hall saloon, craving a beer and female companionship. he has unexpected encounter with his estranged wife, lou (olga bachonova). during his absence of three years, she has become a habitué of the saloon, where she freely enjoys male companionship. the “couple” joins one another for a drink: no love is lost between them. the stoker bill roberts - a swaggering brawler when on leave - rescues a drowning prostitute named mae (betty compson) who has leapt off the dock to end her sordid life. bill, ignoring the admonishment of his sidekick “sugar” steve (clyde cook), impassively carries the semi-conscious woman to a room above "the sandbar", indifferent to the protests from the proprietor’s wife, mrs. crimp (may foster). lou intercedes to provide first-aid and revives mae, a fallen angel like herself. bill’s growing awareness of mae’s physical beauty assumes a proprietary quality. he fetches her a beverage from the bar and presents her with a pretty dress he steals from a pawn shop next door. bill exhorts her to join him for the evening, and mae, distraught and vulnerable, accepts his invitation. they meet downstairs in the raucous tavern. andy attempts to pull rank and cut in on the couple, but the powerful stoker drives him off with blows. lou, observing her husband’s boorishness, looks on with contempt. mae and bill mutually confess their sexual histories to one another, she with regret, he with masculine pride. so as to win mae’s favors for the night, bill consents to marry her on the spot and mae wistfully obliges. the local missionary “hymn book” harry (gustav von seyffertitz) is summoned and sternly delivers the sacrament. lou provides mae with a ring: her own, now superfluous wedding ring. the couple takes their vows, each shamefacedly, while the formerly boisterous patrons observe with mock solemnity, then erupt in cheers when the newlyweds kiss. the following morning, bill slips quietly from the flophouse honeymoon suite, without a word to mae. andy, observing that the stoker is abandoning his “wife”, goes to mae’s room, where she has just discovered bill’s desertion. andy attempts to force himself on her, but lou arrives and guns him down. the police suspect mae of the murder, but lou confesses and is arrested. under the blandishments of “sugar” steve, bill takes leave of mae - the influence of the possessive "sugar" steve. driven to distraction by his perfidy, she angrily drives him from the her room. aboard the steamer, bill has an epiphany. he bolts from the subterranean furnaces to the sunny deck, leaps overboard and swims to shore. there he inquires as to mae’s whereabouts and discovers that she is in custody at night court, charged with stealing the clothing he had bestowed on her. moments after the judge sentences her to jail, bill presents himself and confesses to the crime, exonerating mae. he pledges to reunite with mae after he serves his 60-day sentence, and she agrees to wait for him.

coal miner hagon derk (charles bickford) is sentenced to hang for murder. his only concern is for his young sister katie (muriel mccormac), who will be left all alone. frivolous socialite cynthia crothers (kay johnson) has her own troubles. by the terms of her grandfather's will, if she is not married by her twenty-third birthday (only a month away), she will not inherit his millions and will be left penniless. she is "engaged" to roger towne (conrad nagel), but he is married to marcia (julia faye). marcia has her own lover, marco (joel mccrea), and is willing to grant roger a divorce ... for the right price. the two women haggle behind roger's back and settle on $100,000. hagon, desperate to provide for katie, offers his body for $10,000 in a newspaper ad. cynthia sees it and goes to see him. she offers him the money in exchange for him marrying her. he accepts. just minutes before hagon's execution though, the real killer is goaded into attacking a man with a gun and is fatally shot. he confesses before dying, and hagon is released. hagon goes to see his stunned wife. when her friends show up to party the night away, he sees cynthia writing a $25,000 check as down payment to marcia and discussing the terms of their agreement. in a confrontation between the group, hagon grabs the check stashed in marcia's garter, showing it to roger as proof that he's been made a pawn. roger tells cynthia that he will settle with marcia himself but if cynthia gives her the check, they're through. cynthia rips up the check as marcia threatens to expose the plot. the pair go downstairs where cynthia reveals to the party happening that she married another man. hagon reveals himself as her husband and the party devolves into a crude mockery of the marriage, bringing reality to cynthia's fear of being made a laughingstock. having had enough, hagon throws out the partygoers which frightens the men and arouses the women. cynthia shows little appreciation for the act of saving her from the mockery and locks herself in her room. hagon resolves to return her money and breaks down her door to speak to her. after a brief confrontation, hagon flings $10,000 at her and leaves. when cynthia is informed that she must actually be living with her husband on her birthday, she drives to his mining town. he refuses to go back to her palatial apartment, so she persuades him to let her stay with him. he agrees on condition that she cook and clean, just like a real wife, and locks up her fancy car in his tool shed. her first attempt at preparing a meal is a dismal failure. katie kindly helps out and keeps it a secret from hagon, but cynthia confesses on her own. hagon tells her it is the first honest thing he has seen her do. the next day, while shopping at the local store, cynthia buys a gift for a young boy. his mother objects, but the child runs away with his present and is hurt in a traffic accident. the doctor says that only a brain specialist in the city can save him, but the boy only has hours to live. cynthia breaks into the tool shed, speeds away in her car and returns with the specialist. the child is saved. hagon returns from work to find the door of his tool shed demolished and learns that cynthia withdrew $2,000 from the bank (to pay the specialist). he assumes that she got tired of his way of life and went to see roger. when hagon demands an explanation, cynthia is too disheartened to reply. she telephones roger to come for her. however, the child's mother tells hagon what cynthia has done. when roger shows up, he insists on seeing hagon before leaving. they go down into the bowels of the mine to find him. a cave-in traps the trio with only fifteen minutes worth of air. hagon finally confesses he loves cynthia. then he realizes there is a way out. he quickly packs a stick of dynamite into a wall; there is another chamber on the other side with enough air to sustain them until they can be rescued. however, without a fuse cap, someone will have to strike the dynamite with a sledgehammer to set it off. after arguing, the two men toss a coin for the privilege. roger "wins", but hagon wrestles the sledgehammer away from him. after cynthia whispers something to roger, he tells hagon that cynthia loves roger wants to say goodbye to him. when hagon goes to cynthia, he asks her to get on with saying what she needs to say. confused, she reveals that she said she loves hagon. with the two safely out of the way, roger sets off the dynamite and is blown to pieces.

seven faces
a common convention in the early decades of newspaper and magazine film reviews was to describe in the write-up the entire storyline including, in a substantial number of instances, the ending, thus unintentionally enabling subsequent generations of readers to reconstruct a lost film's contents. true to form, those who evaluated seven faces, such as mordaunt hall of the new york times,[6] did go into considerable detail regarding plot twists, as related herein below.[7][8][9][10] papa chibou (paul muni), the elderly caretaker of musée pratouchy, a parisian wax museum, feels a strong kinship with the figures, particularly with that of napoleon. he spots at the waxworks a romantic young couple, georges (russell gleason), a lawyer, and helene (marguerite churchill), the daughter of a stern judge (lester lonergan) who disapproves of his daughter's choice and forbids her to see georges. papa chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of napoleon's uniform. however, a missing letter and confusion in communication causes georges to arrive at the mistaken conclusion that helene has redirected her affections towards a foolish young man (walter rogers), who is unworthy of her and excessively preoccupied with his stylish personal appearance and elegant clothing. seeing their lovers' quarrel, papa chibou attempts to mollify the heated language, but george and helene rebuff his soothing words by telling him not to interfere, since as an old man he knows nothing of love. saddened by this rejection, he dreamily imagines that seven of the museum's waxworks come to life and offer philosophical advice on the intricacies of courtship and love. don juan, the legendary 17th century libertine, napoleon (1769–1821),[11] franz schubert (1797–1828), african american boxer joe gans (1874–1910),[12] willie smith, a cockney costermonger who became a music hall attraction after winning a lottery-auction known as calcutta sweepstakes[13] and a parisian hypnotist whose purported mastery of dark arts earned him the stage name diablero (all portrayed by muni) as well as catherine the great (1729–1796) (portrayed by salka stenermann) speak to papa chibou, each in his or her own unique manner and accent, providing insight and personal experience in their reflections on this very intimate topic.[14][15] the wax museum is unable to support itself and has to close. the owner, monsieur pratouchy (gustav von seyffertitz) puts the figures up for auction and papa chibou bids his life savings to acquire napoleon, but is outbid. he then decides to take the waxwork and, while struggling to carry the heavy and unwieldy life-size figure in his arms through paris streets, attracts public attention and is arrested for theft. at his trial, the judge is helene's father, while the defense attorney is georges, the young romantic, who delivers an impassioned summation vividly describing how the defendant was overcome by patriotic fervor over napoleon's victories and his contributions to the glory and grandeur of his beloved france. although the judge finds papa chibou guilty, as required by law, he is so impressed that he suspends the punishment and contributes towards the purchase price of the figure which is given to papa chibou who then confesses that as an uneducated man he never knew that napoleon had accomplished all those great deeds and that he simply formed a close attachment to him. "then who did you think napoleon was", he is asked. "a sort of murderer", he replies.[16] at that point, as he straightens napoleon's pockets, papa chibou discovers the overlooked letter which explains and resolves georges' and helene's misunderstanding, thus allowing the young lovers an opportunity to declare their true feelings, with her father's blessing.

in hungary, a beautiful, young gypsy girl, nubi, seeks shelter during a sudden squall. nubi is given shelter by a well-to-do farmer and his family. the farmer and his family hide the girl when a brutish, older gypsy lover arrives to claim the girl and take her away. the older gypsy leaves, and nubi is allowed to stay on with the family as a servant. nubi does little useful work as a servant in the house, and instead proceeds to use her feminine charms to entice and bewitch various male members of the household, leading to many scenes of discord, anger, and jealousy. the spell that nubi has put on the house is only lifted at the end of the movie when the older gypsy returns, and carries nubi away -- with the farmer and his family no longer willing to offer protection to the troublesome gypsy girl.

the valiant
the credits (accompanied by organ music endemic to silent films), segue into title card: "a city street-----where laughter and tragedy rub elbows." a crowded block lined with tenement buildings, on manhattan's lower east side, comes into view, followed by a look into the hallway of one of those buildings, then a shot is heard, a door to one of the apartments opens and a man holding a gun (paul muni) backs out, closes the door, puts the gun in his pocket, then walks down flights of stairs and into the busy street. while he passes along sidewalks teeming with human activity, an irish american policeman berates a driver for parking in front of a hydrant, but when the driver removes his scarf, revealing a clerical collar, the abashed officer apologizes and offers to accompany the priest to the beat of "that cop on the next corner, he's not one of us". at that point, the shooter approaches and makes a gesture to speak, but the priest has already started to drive off, with the officer standing on the car's running board. continuing to walk, the shooter reaches a police precinct and goes inside. approaching the desk lieutenant (clifford dempsey), who asks, "well, what's on your mind?", he replies, "i killed a man", explaining that the victim lived at 191 east 8th street, was named john harris, and "deserved to die". asked for his own name, he hesitates and, spotting a wall calendar (showing may 1928) with a large ad for "dyke & co., inc.", says "dyke... james dyke". to "why are you giving yourself up?", he answers "it was the only thing to do". the subsequent title card states: "civilization demands its toll." in court, the killer is only willing to explain that "i never struck anybody in anger in all my life, but when i knew what he had done, i had to kill him." the judge (henry kolker) ultimately proclaims that "it is the duty of this court to sentence you to be executed at the state's prison during the week of august seventeenth." another title card: "meanwhile------in a far-away home...." in the backyard of a countryside house, a young woman (marguerite churchill) is attending to her dogs, while her wheelchair-bound mother (edith yorke) is sitting nearby. a young man (john mack brown) arrives and greets the mother as "mrs. douglas", while she addresses him as "robert" and tells him that it was on such a nice day as this that she last saw her son joe. robert hands her "your columbus paper" and goes to greet the young woman, "mary", who calls him "bob". he unsuccessfully attempts to help mary bathe one of the dogs and, when she falls trying to catch the dog, bob impulsively kisses her and then proposes. mary's mother calls and shows them a photograph of "james dyke" in the paper with the lead "condemned man's story of his life as it should have been. a lesson to youth on folly of crime by the man of mystery". she tells them that he looks like the long lost joe, but mary says that it must be a mistake and there's happy news in that bob proposed and after the marriage they will all live together. the next title card describes "gray walls, claiming their forfeits of liberty------and life." prisoners are seen laboring in a field outside the prison and, as they return to the mess hall for a meal, a stage above the dining area features an orchestra consisting of african american prisoners, replete with a smiling bandleader, playing dance music for the prisoners as they eat. "dyke" is brought to the office of the warden (dewitt jennings) who asks him about any family members whom he might like to contact, but the condemned man replies that he has no one. leaving the office, he hears the jaunty melodies resonating from the dining area and says, "i didn't know you had music... here". a newspaper's printing machines are seen churning out the evening edition with the headings: "mystery of dyke's identity secret as hour of death nears. prisoner staunchly refuses to divulge secret of himself or the motive for his crime though he faces chair. james dyke maintains silence as he writes news paper articles warning youth on the folly of crime." one of the printers (unbilled robert homans) tells the other that he heard the paper was paying dyke $2,500 for his writings and that dyke was buying liberty bonds with the money. sitting in her bedroom, the infirm mrs. douglas visualizes long-ago memories of teenage joe (unbilled barton hepburn) describing to his little sister mary about being cast in a local shakespeare play and that, at bedtime, instead of "goodnight", she should recite to him the "parting is such sweet sorrow" lines and he would respond with the "sleep dwell upon thine eyes" lines. meanwhile, in the living room, mary and bob are in the midst of a party to celebrate their engagement and, as the happy couple and invited guests dance, everyone joins in singing a fast chorus of "hosanna, hosanna, sing hosanna today". briefly leaving their guests to check on mrs. douglas, mary and bob hear from her that despite fragile health, she has decided to make the long trip to visit "james dyke" in prison, because the possibility that he might be joe is making the uncertainty unbearable. mary offers to travel on her mother's behalf, with bob accompanying her on the trip and, as they are riding on the train, a little girl passenger who says that her name is suzanne (unbilled helen parrish) asks if they also have a little girl, prompting mary to tell bob that she couldn't marry him "if this man in prison should be my brother", because "it wouldn't be fair to you" and "people are cruel". a title card indicates "the test of the valiant." dyke is escorted to the warden who commends his exemplary behavior and asks what he wants done with the $2,500 in liberty bonds which are being held here in the office for him. dyke replies that he'll think of something. also present is the chaplain (richard carlyle) who, along with the warden, tries to convince him to see the young lady who traveled a thousand miles to speak with him in the hope that he might be her long-lost brother. dyke eventually agrees, but requests privacy for the meeting, which is granted. the warden initially speaks with mary alone, learning that she is from the (fictitious) town of pennington in ohio, that her father died when she was a baby, that joe, who is ten years older, left home fifteen years ago because "he wanted to be in the city" and has not been heard from since. she is certain, however, that she could recognize him from his reactions to their long-ago "goodnight" verses from romeo and juliet. as dyke is brought into the office, the warden, the chaplain and the guard exit, leaving the two alone, but with all doors open. after mary's explanation, dyke denies being her brother, says he is from canada, not ohio, and does not react to the verses. as mary is about to leave, however, he asks her to repeat her name and her brother's name and then tells her that when he served with the canadian forces during the war (world war i), a fellow showed great valor in sacrificing his life and the dead hero's name was joseph anthony douglas. there will be a record of his service, but as occasionally happens in war, other details, including his ultimate fate, may be lost. however, she should take the unopened envelope (containing the liberty bonds) to her mother and buy for her a gold star to put on the front door in honor of her fallen son. mary asks if there is anything she can do and he responds that her touch would mean the world to him. after hugging him, mary leaves with the envelope and then "james dyke" softly recites to himself the "sleep dwell upon thine eyes" lines as the time for his execution arrives. back in pennington, mary and bob sit by the piano, while mrs. douglas rests in her wheelchair on the porch, visualizing marching doughboys and then her young son's smiling face while he is also wearing such a uniform. as bob and mary wheel her inside, the front door slowly swings closed, revealing the display of a large star.

harold bledsoe, a student of botany, is traveling by rail to san francisco, where the captain of police has sent for him to help investigate a crime wave in the city's chinatown district. since harold is the son of san francisco's former police captain, municipal authorities hope he will be as skilled as his father in solving crimes. also traveling to the city, but by car, are two people unknown to harold. they are a young woman named billie lee and her little brother buddy, who is in dire need of having his lame leg treated in san francisco by "the famous chinese physician" dr. chang gow.[3][4] during a brief train stop in colorado, harold has his photograph taken at a vending machine. he is surprised to see in the print the face of an attractive woman next to his. actually, billie lee had taken her photo at the same machine before harold, but the film failed to develop properly, thus leaving her image on his double-exposed print. harold's train halts again later for a minor repair; and while waiting outside the passenger car, he sees an unusual blossom on a nearby tree. he goes to fetch it but is unable to reach high enough, so he stands on the back of a cow. suddenly, the train's whistle blows, which causes the cow to bolt with harold holding on desperately. the animal soon throws him off on a dirt road where billie and buddy's old car sits with an apparent engine problem. harold does not recognise billie as the woman on his photograph; in fact, he thinks she is a boy since she is wearing a man's cap and overalls to work on the engine. harold tries to help, but he only complicates things and repeatedly insults billie. after she removes the carburetor, a passing motorist suggests they check their car's gas tank, which is indeed empty. the motorist gives them some fuel; but after he leaves, billie realizes that she left the carburetor on the other car's running board. now they must spend the night along the roadside. harold makes billie do much of the work setting up camp as he sits mooning over the mysterious woman in his photograph. billie saw earlier that it is her image, but she does not tell him. after enduring more physical and verbal abuse from harold, she finally changes her clothes in a tent and then shocks him by reappearing in a dress. he now recognizes her and flees, embarrassed by his boorish behavior. she catches him and asks if he still thinks she is as beautiful as in the photograph; he says yes. next morning, the trio harness the cow to pull their car to a gas station. harold then separates from billie and buddy to catch another westbound train. once in san francisco and at police headquarters, harold is introduced to the process of fingerprinting, which intrigues him. he causes chaos at the station for the next two weeks by using the messy, fine black powder to take fingerprints of everyone at the building, including the print of a visitor, john thorne, a respected citizen who is pressuring the police to crack down on crime. harold's antics continue to anger staff at the station, so the desk sergeant hatches a scheme to get rid of him. he sends him on a mission to find the "dragon", the mysterious master of the city's chinese underworld. to "aid" herold in his search, the sergeant gives him mr. thorne's fingerprint, but he lies and tells him it is the dragon's print. harold goes to chinatown, where he sees billie in her car. she gives him the address where she and buddy are residing in the city. harold then passes a flower shop and sees a beautiful potted flower he wants to purchase for billie, but the employees refuse to sell it. determined to have one, he throws money on the floor and dashes out of the shop with the flower and evades two employees in hot pursuit. he next visits billie and gives her the flower. dr. gow is also there examining buddy's leg. as he departs, he accidentally knocks the flower off a table and breaks its pot, revealing a package of opium. telling them to say nothing about the drug, the doctor goes to the flower shop, where he is kidnapped. later, harold and billie hear radio news that dr. gow had been seized and may be killed. fearing his death would deprive buddy of any hope of a permanent recovery, harold leaves to rescue the doctor. in chinatown, harold sees clancy, a street cop he had met earlier; and together they go to the shop. aware of their presence, employees there set up a series of spooky effects to frighten them from the premises; yet, harold and clancy remain despite being terrified. clancy does leave briefly to call for more officers before returning. fights then begin with chinese gang members and continue in passageways beneath the shop. harold wanders through the basement area and soon encounters the masked dragon and some of his men preparing to execute dr. gow. harold manages to prevent the murder and struggles with the dragon, who escapes with his hostage before the police burst in and arrest everyone else. when the police return to the station with harold and gang members, billie is already there, eager to find him. the police inform harold about misleading him with the dragon’s fingerprint. he is mortified until he notices in a mirror that in his fight with the dragon, the drug lord had left his sooty fingerprint on harold's forehead, and it matches thorne's print. harold tries to explain the significance of this find to his colleagues, who only ridicule him. thorne then appears at the station, and harold instantly denounces him. as an influential public figure, thorne is thought to be above suspicion, so the police apologize for harold's behavior and try to detain him. he gets away and follows thorne to his home, where he eventually extracts a confession from him. the police arrive and remain skeptical that thorne is the dragon until harold finds dr. gow gagged and bound in a closet in thorne's study. thorne is arrested, and the film ends with billie accepting harold's clumsy proposal of marriage.

words and music
two young college students, phil (david percy) and pete (john wayne), compete for the love of pretty girl named mary (lois moran), and also to win the $1500 prize in a song-writing contest to write the best show tune for the annual college revue. the two men each ask mary to sing for them, but eventually, she chooses phil as her beau, and it is he who also has the winning song. although the film was largely devoid of much plot line, as was typical of musical revue pictures of the period, there is a great deal of singing and dancing. many of lois moran’s numbers were actually footage that was cut from the film fox movietone follies of 1929, which were edited out when the film was found to be too long. this film was created to make use of the deleted scenes, and so was fashioned around moran’s singing talent. songs include: "too wonderful for words" (william kernell, dave stamper, paul gerard smith, edmund joseph), "stepping along" (kernell), "shadows" (con conrad, sidney d. mitchell, archie gottler).

all quiet on the western front
professor kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the army and "saving the fatherland". on the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by paul baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd company. their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive corporal himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, "you're going to be soldiers—and that's all." the new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. one in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (behn). the new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. the young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. they have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. one of them, "kat" katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. the young soldiers "pay" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes. the new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. after spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. they are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead. the men start out eating greedily, but then settle into a satiated torpor. they hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the causes of the war and of wars in general. they speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the kaiser; kat jokes that instead of having a war, they should have the leaders of europe be stripped to their underwear and "fight it out with clubs". one day, corporal himmelstoss arrives to the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation; he is forced to go over the top with the 2nd company and is promptly killed. in an attack on a cemetery, paul stabs a french soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails miserably to stop him from dying. he cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. later, he returns to the german lines and is comforted by kat. going back to the front line, paul is severely wounded and taken to a catholic hospital, along with his good friend albert kropp. kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. around this time, paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find kropp in depression. paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home. he is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final "push for paris" is soon to occur. when paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds professor kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students. professor kantorek asks of paul to detail his experience, to which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners; this revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call paul a "coward". disillusioned and angry, paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by tjaden. he goes to find kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war. kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so paul carries him back to a field hospital - only to find that kat has been killed by a second explosion. crushed by the loss of his mentor, paul leaves. in the final scene, paul is back on the front lines. he sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. paul smiles and reaches out towards the butterfly, but becoming too exposed, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper. the final shot shows the 2nd company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery.

animal crackers
a newspaper headline explains that society matron mrs. rittenhouse is holding a lavish party at her home in long island. the party will host renowned explorer captain geoffrey (or jeffrey) t. spaulding as the guest of honor, recently returned from africa. also, as a special treat for the guests and capt. spaulding, revered art collector roscoe w. chandler will unveil his recently acquired painting by famous fictional artist beaugard. hives instructs the servant crew on preparations for the party ("he's one of those men"). chandler arrives with the beaugard and proceeds to set it up to be displayed. capt. spaulding's assistant horatio jameson announces the captain's arrival ("i represent the captain") ("hooray for captain spaulding, part i"). capt. spaulding makes a grand entrance and announces that he cannot stay and must leave immediately (hello, i must be going"). mrs. rittenhouse begs him to stay and the guests declare their admiration for the captain and he decides to stay ("hooray for captain spaulding, part ii"). soon after, signor emanuel ravelli arrives with his colleague the professor, hired to provide music for the weekend event. after an elaborate introduction, the professor scares the guests away with a pistol he grabs from capt. spaulding's supplies. the professor soon takes off chasing after an attractive blonde party-goer. mrs. rittenhouse's daughter arabella is attending the party with her fiancé john parker, who is a struggling painter. john feels discouraged because he hasn't been able to make a living with his art in order to support himself and arabella. arabella suggests john do a portrait for chandler, suggesting he would receive an impressive commission. john laughs at the idea, not believing chandler to have a genuine appreciation for art. after examining the beaugard, arabella devises a scheme to win chandler's interest in john's work: they'll replace the beaugard with an almost perfect copy of it john painted in art school, since they can find no obvious differences. after the painting is unveiled at the party, they will surprise everyone and hopefully convince chandler to hire john. arabella asks ravelli to switch the paintings. meanwhile, another guest, neighbor mrs. whitehead thinks up the same idea with her friend grace carpenter as a means of humiliating mrs. rittenhouse. they grab grace's poorly made copy that she painted and ask hives to put it in place of the beaugard, unaware that they are taking out john's copy. ravelli catches the professor chasing after the blonde girl and scolds him. soon mrs. rittenhouse and mrs. whitehead arrive and the four proceed to play an absurd variation on bridge. ravelli and the professor run into chandler and recognize him as abie the fish peddler from czechoslovakia. chandler tries to bribe the two in order to keep them quiet, but they end up taking his money, tie and garters as well as, miraculously, chandler's birthmark which is transferred to the professor's arm. after a series of strange interludes while speaking with mrs. rittenhouse and mrs. whitehead, capt. spaulding has a debate with chandler outside on the balcony after his encounter with ravelli and the professor. later that night in the middle of a thunderstorm, ravelli and the professor attempt to replace the beaugard with the power going on and off, making the job more difficult. in the middle of the job capt. spaulding and mrs. rittenhouse wander in, making the job more difficult. they succeed in replacing the painting. during the party, mrs. rittenhouse invites capt. spaulding to speak about his travels in africa. he proceeds to tell a ridiculous and absurd account of his travels before mrs. rittenhouse cuts him off. signor ravelli is invited to play some selection on the piano (i'm daffy over you", "silver threads among the gold", "gypsy chorus"). after several quips and interruptions chandler invites the guests into the parlor so he can unveil the beaugard. once revealed, chandler notices the poor quality and realizes someone has stolen his painting and replaced it with a cheap imitation. john feels discouraged, thinking the painting is still his copy. suddenly the power goes out, and when restored, the imitation beaugard is missing as well. the guests, now in an uproar, scatter and attempt to find the stolen painting, led by capt. spaulding. john and arabella discuss the excitement of the situation and their love for each other ("why am i so romantic?"). the next day, a police squad arrives to secure the house and search for the missing painting. realizing that they may have gone too far, mrs. whitehead and grace ask hives for the beaugard he took back, but he can't find it anywhere. mrs. whitehead deduces the professor must have stolen it. after confronting him she gets grace's copy back. later, john finds grace's copy of the beaugard and reveals to arabella that someone else must have had the same idea as them. realizing that chandler never actually saw john's copy, they become more hopeful. soon after john realizes the copy he found is now missing. capt. spaulding, jameson, and ravelli discuss how they might go about finding the missing painting. after getting the painting back from the professor, who is now in disguise, john and arabella bring it to capt. spaulding. they figure out that the professor must be the one who stole the paintings, and enlist the police to help find him. after a brief altercation spaulding, ravelli, and jameson enter with the professor ("my old kentucky home"). the professor is apprehended and the three paintings are returned. chandler momentarily mistakes john's copy for the beaugard. realizing his talent, chandler hires john to do a series a portraits for him. after momentarily letting the professor go free, the police sergeant tries to apprehend him. to escape arrest, the professor sprays the guests with a knockout substance from a flit can. after everyone is laid out on the floor and fully subdued, the film concludes with the professor knocking himself out next to the pretty blonde he has been chasing throughout the entire film.

the bishop murder case
looking out from his private balcony, elderly prof. dillard and his servant see the body of family friend joseph robin with an arrow in his chest. dillard calls district attorney markham, who brings in private detective philo vance and lazy police detective heath. vance quickly deduces that the arrow scene was staged (robin was actually bludgeoned inside the house), but there is no obvious suspect. vance and the others repeatedly interview dillard and his friends and neighbors. living with dillard is his niece belle; dillard's adopted son, sigurd arnesson, who is also belle's boyfriend, returns from college on hearing of the crime. in the next house are the drukkers, a brother and sister: she feels responsible for a serious injury he still suffers from, and is now very frail and agoraphobic. she says she saw nothing of the crime; her brother says he heard her screaming in her room, which she denies. he also admits to being in dillard's house before the murder. another neighbor is john pardee, a chess enthusiast, who seems to be overly interested in the case. a taunting typewritten note is found, signed "the bishop". it alludes to the nursery rhyme "cock robin": robin was nicknamed cock robin, and another visitor at the house that day was named sperling—german for "sparrow". however, sperling eventually proves to have a solid alibi. dillard has no typewriter in the house, and neither drukker's nor bishop's matches the note. later a friend of arnesson's, named john, is found murdered. he was shot in the top of the head, apparently in allusion to jack's injury in the rhyme "jack and jill". then drukker, sitting on a low wall in a park at night, is pulled off the wall and murdered. "the bishop" continues sending notes about each crime, connecting the last one to "humpty dumpty". drukker's sister is found dead also, perhaps from fright, and a valuable notebook about his research work is missing from their home. a chess bishop has been left in her hand. heath and markham become suspicious of pardee and go to arrest him, but find him dead. next to his body, obviously built after he died, is a house of cards with a chess bishop on top: it is "this is the house that jack built". later, dillard expresses some misgivings about arnesson, and mentions the henrik ibsen play the pretenders, which arnesson is fond of. that night, after belle says goodnight to arnesson, she makes her way into the attic and finds the typewriter that "the bishop" used for his notes. at this point she is jumped from behind. mulling over dillard's words later that night, vance suddenly realizes that one of the characters in the pretenders is a bishop—named arnesson. he rushes back to dillard's house together with markham, heath, and more police. arnesson's window is open and neither he nor belle is in their room. dillard joins the group to search the house, breaking down the locked door to the attic. there they find the typewriter, but not belle, who is lying bound and gagged in a nearby cupola. downstairs, they are talking to dillard when arnesson returns. when vance accuses him, he acts guilty. meanwhile dillard surreptitiously pours some powder from a compartment in his ring into a wine glass. as things calm down and arnesson is about to be arrested, dillard offers him a glass, then pours more wine for himself; but vance announces that he has switched the glasses. dillard is the murderer, and was trying to fake arnesson's suicide. he wanted to be belle's only friend. he originally only intended to kill robin and frame arnesson, but developed the more elaborate scheme when he realized miss drukker must have witnessed his actions. vance had tipped arnesson to act guilty, and had heath search the cupola after dillard left the attic; belle is fine. arnesson and belle embrace, and vance stops heath from carelessly drinking the poison.

call of the flesh
in seville, spain, a cantina is located across the street from san agustín convent. at the convent, postulant maria consuelo vargas (dorothy jordan) receives a visit from her brother, captain enrique vargas (russell hopton). they have not seen each other in seven years, as he has been stationed in africa. during the intervening time, their mother has died, which left maria alone in the world, until she entered the convent. enrique is thrilled that she will soon be married to god. maria is enthralled by the music that comes from across the street – implying that she wants to explore life outside the convent - but enrique prefers that she remain behind the safety of the convent walls, as he considers the outside world evil. after enrique leaves, maria peers over the convent walls to watch juan de dios (ramon novarro) perform at the cantina. later in the set, juan sings and dances with his partner, lola (renée adorée). after the set, juan flirts with some female customers, which irks lola. juan walks lola home, during which time he treats her badly, knowing that she is in love with him, and thus will tolerate the abuse. at home, juan meets with his music teacher, esteban (ernest torrence). esteban believes juan has the makings of a great singer like he himself once was. esteban squandered away his fame and fortune by reckless behavior – the same reckless behavior juan now exhibits – which he is trying to steer juan away from. if his old contacts will listen, esteban plans to take juan to madrid so that he can truly become a great serious singer under the management of one of the great impresarios. after a day outing at the market where he steals some oranges and some cloth and thus is trying to escape from the police, juan runs into maria in a private courtyard, she who he has never met. she has escaped from the convent and is stealing a dress from a clothes line to replace her convent garb. she leaves a token for the dress. she recognizes him. as she tells him she has no home, he, who is immediately attracted to her, takes her home with him. maria eventually tells juan that she has escaped from the convent to find “him”, as she has always been drawn to the magic that is his singing. then, lola shows up. juan is able to make her go away without knowing that maria is there. esteban believes maria to be nothing more than a street harlot, but juan is able to convince him that she is a child of god. juan then tells esteban that they will indeed go to madrid, and bring maria along as their housekeeper. at the convent, enrique is trying to find maria. the mother superior (nance o'neil) tells him that as maria had not yet taken her vows, she was free to leave. maria being drawn to music may provide a clue as to her whereabouts. then, lola arrives – she has found a convent garment in juan’s room, the garment which enrique and the mother superior recognize as maria’s. enrique vows to travel to madrid to kill juan. in madrid, juan, esteban and maria rent a three-bedroom flat that is managed by a music aficionado, la rumbarita (mathilde comont). a once great singer used to reside there, which they all believe is karma. later at the audition with impresario mischa, juan displays his arrogant attitude about what he sees as the greatness of his singing. although the audition is technically sound, mischa tells juan that he has no soul in his singing, and that he needs to have his heart broken to achieve true greatness. as such, mischa, will not accept him as a client. after juan storms out in disgust, esteban negotiates payment – all the money that he has - to mischa to take juan on as a client in lower level musical events, juan not to know the financial arrangement. mischa happily agrees, seeing this arrangement as a windfall. back at the flat, juan, angry about mischa’s assessment, takes it out on maria by berating her. but seeing how loyal she is to him, juan changes his tune and declares his undying love for her. they embrace. later, he visits a priest to make arrangements for their marriage. as juan tells esteban and la rumbarita of the wedding, they go off to buy items for an engagement celebration party, but not before esteban is able to tell juan that mischa has arranged for him to sing pagliacci that evening. juan is excited, but believes that mischa has just come to his senses, not knowing about esteban and mischa’s financial arrangement. while juan is alone at the flat, enrique tracks juan down, ready to kill him. although they initially argue about the situation with maria, enrique, with a little help from lola, is able to convince juan to send maria back to the convent, as his act of love is stealing her away from her vow to god, and that she would always be seen as harlot if they were to get married, thus sending her to eternal damnation. knowing that maria will not go willingly, juan convinces maria that he no longer loves her as he has reconciled with lola. a tearful maria, now believing the outside world is evil as enrique once said, leaves with her brother back to seville and san agustín. despite juan’s broken heart, esteban is able to convince juan to proceed with the performance of pagliacci by telling him the truth about his and mischa’s financial arrangement. juan’s performance ends up being a triumph, with juan emotionally spent after it. mischa remarks that this juan and the juan at the audition are two totally different people. mischa now wants to sign a legitimate contract with juan. regardless, juan does not recover emotionally. as esteban takes him back to seville, juan is bedridden, dying from a broken heart. seeing what is happening to juan, lola decides to go to the convent to tell maria the truth about their deception, which lola now knows will lead to certain death for both juan and maria of broken hearts. maria rushes to juan’s side, the two who enter into a loving embrace.

for the defense
in new york city, william foster (william powell) is a criminal defense attorney so successful that prosecutors regard him as a menace. he holds himself to high ethical standards but is willing to mislead without actually lying. foster defends a man who planned a murder using explosives. district attorney stone (william b. davidson) displays a vial and says chemical tests have shown that the liquid in it is sensitive nitroglycerin. foster sniffs the liquid, questions him to verify the chain of custody, and then smashes the vial dramatically on the floor. when order is restored, he explains to the judge that he knew it was safe because nitro has a distinctive smell, and stone says he had removed the actual nitro for safety after the chemical test. but foster points out that only the liquid now in the bottle was entered into evidence, and wins his case. foster is in love with actress irene manners (kay francis), and she loves him, but she wants to be married and he does not. when another suitor, jack defoe (scott kolk), proposes to her, she says she needs to tell foster about him before she can accept; but she finds she cannot do so. she stays out late enough at night with defoe to leave only one implication of what they were doing, and while driving him home, she does agree to marry him. he suddenly hugs her and she loses control of the car, killing a bystander. to protect irene's reputation, defoe urges her to leave the scene, lying that the victim is not badly hurt. presumed to have been driving while drunk, he is charged with manslaughter. they both still conceal her involvement, but she begs foster to defend him. he asks why she cares enough about defoe to insist; she says she and defoe are just friends, but she had already promised him on foster's behalf, assuming foster would be willing. foster agrees, but finds that defoe cannot tell a credible story at trial. then foster finds out that irene was at the accident scene and therefore must be much more than "just friends" with defoe. foster is crushed, but she still begs him to get defoe acquitted, while defoe fears foster will throw the case and irene will be charged and convicted as well. foster eventually puts his love for irene first and, for the first time in his life, bribes a juror to vote not guilty, hanging the jury. foster is quickly found out and arrested, and defends himself at trial. as he will not see irene, she goes to stone, admits what really happened at the accident, and says foster was only trying to protect her. if stone does not agree to recommend mercy, irene says, she will tell her story in court. stone says he will think about it. although his defense is going well, foster then offers to plead guilty (and thus be disbarred, no doubt making life easier for prosecutors in future) if only stone will agree not to retry defoe; but stone says he does not make deals. back in court, irene sends foster a note pleading to let her testify and tell the truth. to protect her, foster immediately changes his plea to guilty. stone then tells foster that neither defoe nor irene will be prosecuted. as foster arrives at sing sing to serve his sentence, irene is there and says she will be waiting for him when he comes out. he says that if she does, then he will marry her.

the film takes place in neu posen, german east africa sometime before the first world war. "mamba" is the name given to a south african snake. the reptile of this adventure is auguste bolte (played by jean hersholt), who is constantly reminding those with whom he has a chance to converse that he can buy anything. he neglects his appearance and does not even bother to shave or brush his hair. the german officers hold themselves aloof from him and the only individual he has an opportunity to talk to at length is his valet-secretary, a cockney, who feeds his master with flattery. one afternoon bolte recalls that he has received a letter asking for 200,000 marks from count von linden. the count is in germany and in a footnote it is written that bolte might marry von linden's daughter, helen. the white people of the post have as little to do with bolte as possible and the british officers across the frontier also spurn him. it occurs to bolte that a beautiful wife would perhaps help to make life more agreeable for him. he thinks also that the officers would then overlook some of his failings and be quite impressed. he therefore allies himself to germany. helen (played by eleanor boardman), like most daughters who marry wealthy villains in melodramas, does so to save her father from ruin. there is a flash of the wedding and soon helen and her ignoble husband are seen aboard the steamship bound for east africa. on the same vessel is karl von reiden, the officer who is to take charge of the neu posen post. he is not averse to a little flirtation with a beautiful woman and therefore when helen goes out on deck to avoid bolte, karl succeeds in meeting her. these scenes are fairly well filmed and the color effects are capital. karl, played by ralph forbes, is a handsome fellow. so soon as he knows that bolte is helen's husband he realizes that the marriage is not to her liking. later these passengers are on the river boat, and when that craft reaches neu posen. bolte stands on the aft deck hoping to make all the german officers envious of his attractive bride. he later gives a feast and takes good care to make a show of his wealth, even to having a procession of natives carrying the viands. a visit from a native woman interrupts the proceedings, and in a subsequent passage bolte, enraged with his wife, is about to flog her with a whip when karl comes to the rescue. all this happens just prior to the world war, and in the closing chapters word is received by both the germans and the british that hostilities have been declared. bolte, the snake, believes that money can buy his freedom from military service, but soon he learns otherwise. he is compelled to don a uniform and then decides to run away. his end is sudden, for he fires at one group of natives without knowing that others are behind him. they know something about bolte and his pleas for his life fall on deaf ears. there follow episodes in which karl goes to the rescue of helen and others, who are in danger of an attack by the natives. these are pictured with due attention for red blood on the hero's shirt. it seems that the britishers might have been more solicitous about karl's wounds, but all the british commandant says when he comes up to karl is to ask him whether he will have another piccadilly cigarette.

for morocco is the disillusioned nightclub singer amy jolly (marlene dietrich). wealthy la bessière (adolphe menjou) attempts to make her acquaintance, offering to assist her on her first trip to morocco. when she politely refuses any help, he gives her his calling card, which she later tears up and tosses away. they meet again at the nightclub where she is a new headliner. also in the audience is private tom brown (gary cooper). amy, who comes out in a tophat and tails, is first greeted by boos, which she coolly ignores. tom begins to clap, interrupting their jeers, and others follow suit. after the noise subsides she sings her number ("quand l'amour meurt" or "when love dies") and is met with ecstatic applause. seeing a woman in the audience with a flower in her hair, she asks if she may keep it, to which the woman responds "of course". she playfully kisses the woman on the mouth, and throws the flower to private tom brown. her second performance ("what am i bid for my apple?"), this time in feminine dress, is also a hit. after the number she sells apples to the audience, including la bessière and tom brown. when amy gives the latter his "change", she slips him her key. that night, tom sets out to take amy up on her offer. on the street he encounters adjudant caesar's wife (eve southern). it is clear that she has a past clandestine relationship with him, which she desires intensely to maintain, but toms rejects her. entering amy's house, they become acquainted. her house is plastered with photos from her past, which she, like a foreign legion soldier, reveals nothing of. he asks amy if the man in the photographs is her husband, and she answers that she has never found someone good enough, a sentiment shared by tom. she has become embittered with life and men after repeated betrayals, and asks if he can restore her faith in men. he answers that he is the wrong man for that, and that no one should have faith in him. as they talk, she finds herself coming to like him. unwilling to risk heartbreak once again, she asks him to leave before anything serious happens. as he leaves, he encounters caesar's wife again. her husband, tom's commanding officer, watches undetected from the shadows. meanwhile, amy changes her mind and seeks tom out. with amy in arm, tom leaves madame caesar, who then hires two street ruffians to attack the couple. tom manages to seriously wound both, while he and amy escape unscathed. the next day, tom is brought before adjutant caesar (who had been watching them clandestinely) on the charge of injuring two allegedly harmless natives. amy clears him, but caesar makes him aware that he knows about tom's involvement with his wife. la bessière, whose affections for amy continue unabated, knows her concern for tom and offers to use his weight with caesar to lighten his punishment. instead of a court martial, tom is released from detention and ordered to leave for amalfi pass with a detachment commanded by caesar. he suspects that caesar intends to rid himself of his romantic rival, and fears for his life were he to go. amy is saddened by the news that he is leaving. meanwhile, tom, war-weary and enamored with amy, plans to desert to be with her. that night at the nightclub, la bessière enters amy's dressing room. he gifts her with a lavish bracelet, which she attempts to refuse, before setting it on her table. at the same time tom, intending to tell her of his plans, arrives at the door of her dressing room. tom overhears la bessière offer to marry amy, an offer she politely turns down. la bessière asks her if it is because she is in love, to which she responds that she doesn't think she is. asking her if she would make the same choice if not for "a certain private in the foreign legion", she answers that she does not know. after hearing this tom knocks on the door, and la bessière kindly lets them alone so tom can say goodbye to her. as they embrace, amy tells him not to go, and he responds that that's what he intended to do. he will desert and board a train to europe, but if she would join him. she agrees to this. a buzzer signals it is time for her to perform, and she asks him to wait for her to return. after she departs, he notices the lavish bracelet on her dressing room table. though he has fallen in love with her himself, tom decides that she would be better off with a rich man than with a poor legionnaire. he writes on her mirror, "i changed my mind. good luck!". the next day amy arrives with la bessière to see the company's departure, so that she can bid tom farewell. adding further injury, he hides the depth of his feelings for her by having several women in his company, who cling to him so doggedly that amy must maneuver herself between them to shake his hand. she asks la bessière about the women trailing after the company, who explains that they follow the men. she wonders how they keep pace with them, and he answers "sometimes they catch up with them, and sometimes they don't. and very often when they do, they find their men dead." amy remarks that the women must be mad to do such a thing, to which la bessière responds "i don't know. you see, they love their men." on the march to amalfi pass, tom's company detachment runs into a machine gun nest. caesar orders tom to deal with it, and tom suspects it is a suicide mission. to his surprise, caesar decides to accompany him. caesar is killed by the enemy. though in a relationship with la bessière, amy pines for tom. she is devastated by his treatment of her, and begins drinking heavily and acting erratically at work. la bessière enters her dressing room to find her singing gayly. he asks if she is in high spirits because she has heard news of tom. she leads him to the mirror to show him the note tom left, which she had hidden behind a flower pot. still concealing her grief, she asks him to pour her a drink, before throwing its contents on the mirror and breaking the glass. la bessière consoles her, and amy eventually accepts his proposal. later, at their engagement party, la bessière and amy learn that what's left of tom's detachment has returned. frantic, amy rushes outside, but learns that tom was wounded and left behind to recuperate in a hospital. she informs la bessière that she must go to tom that very night; and wanting only her happiness, he drives her there. she finds that tom has not been injured at all, but has instead been faking an injury to avoid combat. instead of the hospital ward, he has been residing in a canteen. accompanying him is a native woman, who attempts to console him, knowing he is brokenhearted over leaving his love. he has carved "amy jolly" inside a heart, covered by a heap of cigarette butts from his chain smoking. when amy arrives, tom asks her if she is married, to which she answers in the negative. he then asks if she plans to marry la bessière, to which she replies with a yes. he encourages her to marry him, not revealing his feelings for her. as he prepares to join his new unit, she finds his knife on the table, which he has forgotten. when he returns to collect it, she remarks that he has also forgotten to say goodbye. he asks her to see the unit off as they leave at dawn. alone and distraught, amy sifts through the pile of playing cards and cigarettes, and finds the heart with her name in it. the next morning she attends as his unit disembarks. amy is torn in leaving him with the knowledge of his love for her, but when she sees a handful of native women stubbornly following the legionnaires they love, she joins them.
